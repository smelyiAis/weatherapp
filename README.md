First of all, you need to create a weather app folder. Then, inside this folder, you need to create two additional folders: public and views, using the mkdir command in the terminal. Initialize the Node.js Project: "npm init -y" Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js of the project. This will create a package.json file. After that, inside the public folder, you need to create another folder named css, where we will create a style.css file. After that, you need to create an index.ejs file inside the views folder.
